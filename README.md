# My SICP Exercise Answers

This is a repository for my answers to the exercises in the  <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.</a>

This only includes the scheme programming exercises and not the proof-based and writted exercises.


# Scheme/Racket

I used <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">DrRacket</a> for all the exercises with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19546115/which-lang-packet-is-proper-for-sicp-in-dr-racket">SICP language </a> installed.


# Video Lectures

I also followed along with <a href="https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter">Brian Harvey's SICP Video Lectures</a> from Berkley's Computer Science 61A Course.
